# Java-OOP-Retail-System
### **Overview**:
This project is a console-based food ordering and management system developed in Java. It applies core Object-Oriented Programming principles and includes a full set of features to simulate a small business environment—managing customers, employees, scheduling, invoicing, and internal data handling.
<br/><br/>
### **Key Concepts Demonstrated**:    

-Object-Oriented Programming in Java (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)

-UML Class Diagram design and class hierarchy planning

-Internal data persistence using in-program storage structures

-Text-based user interface

-Customer and Employee Management

-Activity Scheduling for Customers

-Automated Invoice Generation

-Input validation and error handling

-Modular, testable code with included test cases
<br/><br/>
### **Project Features**:

-Add, view, and manage food orders

-Manage customer and staff records

-Schedule customer activities handled by employees

-Automatically generate an invoice summary at the end of each transaction

-Text-based console interface for interaction

-Error messages and validations to ensure robust operation
<br/><br/>
### **Interface Style**:
This is a console-based program using text menus and prompts. The focus of the project is to showcase logic, design patterns, and OOP code quality—not GUI or external frameworks.
<br/><br/>
### **Technologies Used**:

-Java (JDK 8+)

-Console-based interface

-UML for design

-Manual data storage (e.g., ArrayLists, HashMaps)
